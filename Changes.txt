Changes:
File .../nanoboard-restore/nanodb.exe-source/PngTransport/Aggregator.cs:
	-	Add code to get the "host_and_folder" "protocol://(domain/IP):PORT/folder"
		and get this from the thread links, like this: "https://0chan.ml/_frct/res/1.html?query=some_query&parameter=value"
	
	-	Get (domain/IP):PORT only (variable "host"), and protocol://(domain/IP):PORT/ without folder (variable "protocol_host_port") - too.
		Now IP:port can be used for threads in "Settings". This will be parsed correctly, if path of PNG is relative, in the response from server.
	
	-	Do this once for each thread, not for each picture.
	
	-	Add regular expression to get picture_host from imageAddress(url in parsed "href") if this contains "http://" or "https://"
	
	-	Block downloading pictures using unknown protocol. For example, "ftp://domain.com/picture.png" in "href" - will be blocked.
	
	-	Change imageAddress by adding pictures relative path from href:
		to "protocol_host_port" (if in href "/images/pic.png" or "./images/pic.png")
		to "host_and_folder" (if in href "../images/pic.png" or "images/pic.png").
	
	-	Add IP-logging attempt prevention:
		if imageAddress contains keyword "logger", or URL shotrers "bit.ly" and "goo.gl" - picture downloading blocked.
		if picture host not thie host of the thread (hard prevention).
		There is possible to comparing protocols+host, because IP-loggers can working on another protocols,
		but if HTTPS board load images using HTTP, this prevention not good.
	
	-	Change m-2ch.ru to m2ch.hk.
	
	-	Add description and second condition as operand for prevent IP-logging, but load pictures from "8ch.net (board)" -> "media.8ch.net (images)".
	
	-	At line 298: Add re-calculating the picture_host for each imageAddress, because many png's from dobrochan
		was been blocked, after downloading PNG from iplogger.org - blocked...

File: .../nanoboard-restore/nanodb.exe-source/Server/DbApiHandler.cs
	-	At line 131: the function was been added parse_number(string string_number), because int.Parse and Int32.Parse not working correctly for me.
	-	At line 150-151: replaced using this. Now last 50 and las 500 messages working good.

Changes in nanoboard 3.2
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Short changes:

	- 	add show-hide post by click on eye. Like on 2ch.hk.
		Two strings from makaba.css used in the tag <style> in index.html.
		Functions added in nanoclient.js and can be founded by keyword "post_type_hidden".
		Post hash saved in LocalStorage.

	-	add separate tab to create PNG.

	-	Add queue button for each post. Now by click to this button any post can be added and removed from queue.
	-	Add page to unpack custom container. 	Now this located by http://127.0.0.1:7346/pages/Open_container.html
	-	Add page to convert images to PNG.		Now this located here: http://127.0.0.1:7346/pages/convert-to-PNG.html

	-	Add check sha256 hash of the file captcha.nbc. This is checking once after try to load captcha. So no need captcha.nbc for readonly mode.
		URL for downloading capcha is not hardcoded, and can be changed to custom URL - in config-3.json.
	-	Add static captcha hash to config-3.json and this value is hardcoded in the code. See nanoboard-source/Captcha/Captcha.cs
	-	Captcha not downloaded if fail, because:
		1. Github using regirect.
		2. This is not anonymous action.
		Need to add proxy, so code to downloading captcha was been commented.
	-	Proxy! This was been added to collectPNG.
		See AddProxy method in /PngTransport/DbApiHandler.cs
		/proxy.txt - list of proxies + comment.
		When collect, each proxy from this list try to ping, then first successfully proxy using as default, and pictures is downloading using this proxy.
	-	Change post validation to bypassValidation, when captcha.nbc not found. No error now.
	-	Add all changes from nanoboard 3.1. See thread http://127.0.0.1:7346/pages/index.html#thread70ca25ba04a241d3b3729611205bf4bb

_____________________________________________________________________
(24.10.2019) Changed 9 files, added 2 files - in 5 folders:
Short changes:
	Add many IP_services, and now this is not hardcoded, and can be customized like places, using txt-file, or "Settings", or in params.js.
	Add proxy in "Settings". Now this can be customized there, or in params.js, or in txt-file.
	Try to connect each proxy for many IP-Services.
	Change proxy for each collect, without restart the program, and select only successfully connected to IP_services proxy.
	Add ability to change proxy, without restart the server program.
		Now, if Bad Requests received, will be enough to just press the button "Collect PNG" again.
	Add default values for places, proxy, and IP_services, in \scripts\params.js. Now, this can be customized there, and this is not hardcoded.
	Small fixes, warnings, etc...

Full changes
Source code:
	\nanodb.exe-source\Server\DbApiHandler.cs
		Just add one string to show notify about starting PNG collect.

	\nanodb.exe-source\PngTransport\Aggregator.cs
		Add two bool variables - is_already_increased_if_proxy, and is_downloading_error.
			Now timeout will not be increasing again and again, if first variable will be true.
			If one item will error of downloading will be showed the notify in the end of collect.
		Add proxy.txt and externalIPservices.txt, now this like places.txt
		Add methods to check update values of this from "Settings" or direcly in "config.json"
		Modify method Aggregate() by adding proxy-list and IP_services, there.
			Now proxy will be changed after each run the collectPNG.
		Modify the method TryConnectProxy()
			Now this try to connect to many IP_Services from list, not one.
			List can be specified in config.json, params.js, or externalIPservices.txt
			if first start (wihtout config.json, or with empty values of corresponding parameters there).
		Modify TryPingProxy() method.
			Timeout of PingProxy was been increased up to 10 seconds. Maybe this need to be increased up to Maximum TTL.
		Modify AddProxy() method
			Check update proxy in the settings on try to add it.
			Do not read list of proxy from proxy.txt, and read this from internal variable.
			Return empty proxy if this was been empty string.
			Add +30 seconds for download timeout if proxy was been used.
			Show the link of proxy in Console, in the end of method.
		Change value of variable proxy to empty proxy, to don't set this global once.
			This value will be setted after starting collect,
			in the method Aggregate in catch, if this proxy will be null or empty.
			Else, this will be just changed there.
		Modify ParseText()
			Add description about bad connection, if null bytes received.
			Show notify, when Bad Request responce was been reveived,
			after try to loading thread using proxy, + notify about error in the end.
				Because this sucessfully finished.
			Show notify about error, if one from the item for dowloading was been not downloaded by Time OUT.

	\nanodb.exe-source\Program.cs
		Add check on the start of program, the update a following parameters:
		places, proxy, and external_IP_services
		if this was been updated from the "Settings", or just by editting config.json.
		Add commented console.log to test from which file was been this calls.

	\scripts\params.js
		Add two params IP_services and List_of_Proxy
		Add default links on IP_services and proxies, there.
		If this was been undefined, and if this parameters will be empty,
		then this script will set this values in config.json on loading index.html.
		Else, values will be loaded from here.

	\pages\params.html
		Resize textareas with proxy, and IP_services, and add title tooltips there.
		Resize textarea with skins.

	\proxy.txt
		Update the proxy list - just add examples of records.
		Add the links to find actual proxy.

	\Changes.txt - add this info, here.

	\nanodb.exe
		Regenerated after recompilation.
	\pages\version.txt
		Regenerated after recompilation.

Add two files:
	\externalIPservices.txt
		Add the links of IP-services which return the text with IP after connect there.
		This need to check proxy connection, if proxy used.
		Proxy will connect to this services, check external IP of this proxy, and return.
		Then program will compare IP, and if this is the same IP, then proxy is working, and will be used to download PNG.
		Else, try to connect to another proxy.
		Connect to this services using only using proxy, as you can see in the source code.
		If proxy working, this will be success, else fail.
		And no any leaks of REAL IP, in this case.

	\places.txt
		Add default places in this file, just as historical data.
		Actually, this can be customized in the settings, and /scripts/params.js
		but on fists loading, when config.json is not found or contains empty values, this data will be loaded from this files.

That's all.
_____________________________________________________________________
(29.02.2019)  82 files is different. Changed 45 files, added 37 files, 3 files was been deleted - in 14 folders.
Short changes:
1. Add lite-server to sharing and hosting the nanoboard. Now this listening on port 7347 (by defalt).
	-	To disable this - run "nanodb.exe old". See Program.cs source code.
	-	Both servers (full-server and lite-server) can working parallel, and accepting the different clients - independent.
	-	Now, is possible to host nanoboard to make able this online for another anonymous users.
	-	Hosting can be in TOR, on onion-domain, without any abuses.
		How to host nanoboard in TOR?
			1. 	Generate onion keypair,
					or find the best RSA privkey for nice onion-domains,
					by using Garlic https://github.com/Artifact0/Garlic
			2.	Download TorBrowser.
			3.	Add two strings in "torrc":
					HiddenServiceDir "HiddenServiceDir "C:\\folder_to_onion_domain_and_key\\nboardn46ay6ycdi.onion"	#folder with two files: "hostname" and "private_key" (RSA private key), generaged by garlic: https://garlic7ravilyupx.onion.ly
					HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:7347
			4. 	Restart TorBrowser.
			5.	Start nanodb.exe.
			6. Go to your onion-site.
	-	Posting - is allowed on lite-server. Captcha is working.
	-	Deletion of posts - is allowed locally (deleted_once and deleted_forever posts hashes saved in LocalStorage).
	-	Added report reason, after first delete on lite-server (max length = 64 symbols, and this is hardcoded, to make substring).
	-	lite-server cann't change parameters on server.
			Some API calls was been disabled. Only places is available and localstorage arrays. Some functions was been commented.
	-	different API for this server - was been added.

2.	Full-server changes:
		- Add file to see reports on full-server /pages/show_reports.html.
			There is possible to see all posts with reports (sorted by number of reports),
			make post "delete_once", make post "delete_forever", delete all reports, or and undelete post, which was been "deleted_once".
		- Now the link of reports is available, when reports exists in the folder "/reports/post_hash.txt",
			because when "post_is_reported" hash of this post contains in array, returned at beginning of loading index.html on full-server,
			So, mark repoted posts and when "post_was_deleted".
		- Add ability to undelete all posts, which was been "deleted_once".
			Now this not filled by nulls in database, and can be recovered by click the button "Undelete".
		- Posts which was been "deleted_once", are available only on full-server. Searching is available. Replies is available too.
		- Posts which was been "deleted_once", are not available on lite-server.
		- Fix deletion of the posts, and loading deleted posts.
		- Fix large response from the server, by writting bytearray in TCP-NetworkStream block-by-block. See changes in TcpClient.cs.
		- Fix uploading posts from JSON of large POST-requests on "/api/upload-posts/". Add two modes to uploading posts from parsed JSON:
			1. 	Old mode0: 		"nanodb.exe large_POST_mode0" 	- previous mode, uploading JSON, after reading TCP-stream. This return OutOfMemoryException for large JSON.
			2. 	Default mode1:	"nanodb large_POST_mode1" 		- uploading posts post-by-post, from readData-string,
																	by parse JSON from the block of this string,
																	and call UploadPost for each post, which was been foud in this string,
																	while TCP-NetworkStream is reading from client.
			3.	Caching mode2:	"nanodb lite large_POST_mode2"	- cache large data of POST-request, and UploadPost post-by-post, from this cache-file, after save this,
																	because client can be disconnected at any time, without get response.
			Warning!
				Now, ALL posts can be downloaded and uploaded, using requests to lite-server, and databases can be synchronized by this way.
				Now nanoboard can be p2p board, if DHT and peer-exchange, can be injected.
				See http://127.0.0.1:7346/pages/TEST_download-upload-posts.html and the source code of \pages\TEST_download-upload-posts.html

		- Rewrite DbApiHandler.cs to get parameters on API by GET and POST-requests. If large parameters transferred in GET-query, encodeURIComponent used for this params.
		- NotificationHandler.cs - add three modes for notifs,
			"notif_mode0" - old mode (empty response for each request, or notif)
			"notif_mode1" - new mode wait notif and return this from recursive function, which is suspend thread, to resume this by timer.
			"notif_mode2" - new mode wait async function which is delegate return value from recursive function in another thread. This seems, like working faster.
			This modes can be specified, as parameter to run nanodb.exe
		- 	Add caching the results of GetReplies, in PostDb.cs, to reduce data comparison operations. Add lock in GetReplies, and in Post.cs - date. Rewrite this method, add comments.
		-	The folder "/download" can be available on lite-server. Pathways for files - was been fixed.
			For example (TorBrowser): http://nboardn46ay6ycdi.onion/download/
			From web: http://nboardn46ay6ycdi.onion.ly/download/
			There can be possible to make "collect PNG", with saving the images, and share this then. Also, there is available captcha.nbc to downloading.
		-	DbApiHandler.cs. Now generate PNG is available on lite-server. See /pages/convert-to-PNG.html.
			Files can be saved in "/download"-folder, and will be available to download it.
			In future, need to realize temporary storage of this file, to prevent DDoS-attack, and some StackOverFlowExceptions/OutOfMemoryExceptions, etc...
		-	DbApiHandler.cs, NbPack.cs, HttpServerBuilder.cs, HttpServer.cs - save files by requests on lite-server in "download/created", "download/generated" - folder,
			to be able to download this on lite-server.
			Delete this file after timeout, which can be changed by running nanodb with parameter lite_images_timeout1800000, where 1800000 - milliseconds to save temporary files, and delete this, then.
		-	Enable "Create PNG"-button, on lite-server. Now notifs about packed posts not added to the queue, and return as HttpResponse for HttpRequest on "../api/png-create".
		-	Now, is possible to disable all notifications for lite-server to prevent DDoS-attack the lite-server, by sending many requests on '/notif'.
		-	Add bypassValidation and allowReput, as parameters to run nanodb. See compile.bat source code.
			Now is possible to make posting without captcha, when bypassValidation = true, upload posts and add many posts.
			Disable error about invalid captcha, when bypassValidation == true, and allow add post without captchs.
			Posts will be added without pow and sign tags, in this case. See changes in reply.js and DbApiHandler.cs
			Warning! In this case is growing the risk of spam and wipes! Deleted posts (including spam/wipe posts, can be re-added, if allowReput = true)!
		-	Change version from 3.2 to 3.3.
		-	Add files /pages/Upload_posts_from_JSON_file.html and /pages_lite/Upload_posts_from_JSON_file.html to upload posts on the remote-server from JSON-file.
		-	Add new method ReadRefs_private(). Read references if this was been changed, and Flush() database every time, after collectPNG, after uploading posts, after downloading posts.
		-	Run nanodb after compilation by default, or disable this, or just run with parameters. See changed in compile.bat.
		-	Run PutPost with parameters allowReput and bypassValidatin, predefined/changed globally.
		-	Add lock in some places.
		-	Add separate dictionary "hash" -> DateTime in PostDb.cs, to sort indexes, and Last Posts by DateTime.
			Save this dictionary to file datetime_by_hash.json, if this was been changed. Do this every time, when Flush() or ReadRefs() runned.

3. Test version of lite-server you can find here: http://nboardn46ay6ycdi.onion/
	Posting is available, by using TorBrowser. Server is unstable, and can go shut-down at any time, but as concept - this is working!
